# 💫 About Me:
<br>🚗🔧 From Automotive Mechatronics to the World of Code 💻<br><br>Proudly recognized as the Best Graduate in Automotive Mechatronics by Salvador Caetano (2018), I built years of hands-on experience as a mechanic. However, my deep-rooted passion for the world of coding has always been a guiding thread throughout my journey.<br><br>Now, at a defining turning point, I am embarking on a new chapter by enrolling in the programming course at 42 Porto. This bold step represents the realization of a long-held dream that was once postponed due to limited opportunities.<br><br>The language of code has fascinated me since childhood, and I am now excited to transform that interest into a vibrant career with the support of 42 Porto. I am highly motivated and ready to embrace any challenge that comes my way.
