With years of **hands-on experience as an automotive mechanic** and the honor of being recognized as the **Best Graduate in Automotive Mechatronics**, I developed a strong problem-solving mindset grounded in real-world challenges.

But beyond tools and engines, I always had a passion for **technology and code** — a curiosity that has now become my new professional path.

Currently, I’m expanding my skill set through the **programming curriculum at 42 Porto** and advanced technical training at **CESAE Digital**, where I’m focused on both **front-end and back-end development**.
