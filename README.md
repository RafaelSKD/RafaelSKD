# <br>üîß From Automotive Mechatronics to the World of Code üíª<br>

<br>Proudly recognized as the Best Graduate in Automotive Mechatronics, I have built years of hands-on mechanical expertise. However, my enduring passion for coding has always been a driving force in my journey.

I am now taking a pivotal step to transform this passion into a professional path through a degree on programming at 42 Porto. Alongside this endeavor, I am eager to bring my skills and commitment to a forward-thinking company that values innovation, growth, and talent development.

Motivated and determined, I am ready to embrace challenges and make a meaningful contribution to the success of my future team.
